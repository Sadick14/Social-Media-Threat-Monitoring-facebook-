## Social Media Threat Monitoring Project: Identifying Malware Links on Facebook

**Project Author:** Sadick Issaka

**Date:** May 2, 2024

**1. Introduction**

Malware poses a significant threat in the digital age.  Malicious actors often use social media platforms to distribute malware through phishing attempts or deceptive links. This project aims to develop a methodology for monitoring Facebook specifically, and identifying potential malware links shared on the platform.

**2. Project Scope**

* **Target Platform:** This project will focus on monitoring Facebook for the initial phase. The approach can be adapted for other platforms in the future.
* **Threats:** The project will target the identification of potential malware links shared on Facebook posts and comments. 
* **Data Collection:** This phase will utilize a combination of manual searches and automated tools like Facebook Search with specific keywords and phrases.

**3. Tools and Methodology**

* **Facebook Search:** Facebook Search offers functionalities to target specific keywords and phrases within posts and comments. The project will utilize keywords and phrases associated with malware distribution, such as "free download," "crack software," "hacking tools," and variations of these terms.
* **Manual Monitoring:**  In addition to automated searches, the project will involve manual review of potentially suspicious posts and comments identified through the keyword search. This will include examining the content surrounding the link and the profiles of the senders.
* **Data Analysis:**  Collected data will be analyzed for patterns, recurring keywords, and suspicious URLs. 

**4. Identifying Malicious Links**

The project will employ the following techniques to identify potentially malicious links:

* **Link Shorteners:**  URLs will be checked for shortening services.  Un shortener tools will be used to reveal the actual destination URL.
* **Domain Scrutiny:**  Domain names will be examined for misspellings of legitimate websites, nonsensical extensions, and other red flags.
* **Context Analysis:**  The content surrounding the link will be reviewed for unrealistic promises, urgency tactics, sender credibility, and inconsistencies in branding or grammar. 

**5. Project Deliverables**

* **Report:** A report will be generated summarizing the methodology, findings, and potential challenges encountered during the project.
* **Recommendations:** Based on the analysis, the report will provide recommendations for ongoing Facebook threat monitoring and mitigation strategies for identifying and preventing the spread of malware links.

**6. Future Enhancements**

* **Expanding Scope:** The project can be expanded to monitor additional social media platforms beyond Facebook.
* **Advanced Threat Detection:**  Exploring paid social listening tools with more advanced features for threat detection and analysis can be considered.
* **Collaboration:**  Collaboration with cybersecurity professionals can provide valuable insights and refine the methodology for real-world application.

**7. Conclusion**

Social media threat monitoring plays a crucial role in safeguarding users from malware threats. This project establishes a foundation for identifying potentially malicious links on Facebook.  By continuously monitoring evolving trends and adapting the methodology, this approach can contribute to a safer online environment.
